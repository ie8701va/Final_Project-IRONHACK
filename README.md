# Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Data ðŸ›’ðŸ“Š  

This repository contains my **final project for Ironhack's Data Analytics course**, focusing on **sentiment analysis of e-commerce data**.  

## Project Overview  
The project analyzes e-commerce product reviews using **sentiment analysis** to classify customer feedback into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories.  

### Key Components  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent data entries.  
   - Standardized date/time formats, converted currencies, and applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Implemented VADER sentiment analysis on cleaned product reviews.  
   - Categorized sentiments into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** groups.  

3. **Multinomial Regression Model**  
   - Trained a multinomial logistic regression model to predict sentiment categories based on features like product price, review content, and category.  
   - Fine-tuned the model through extensive **feature engineering** for optimal performance.  
   - Analyzed the impact of sentiment on **sales** and **profitability**.  

4. **Visualizations**  
   - Created insightful visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, Sankey diagrams, and word clouds, to explore relationships between sentiment, pricing, and categories.  

5. **Business Relevance**  
   - The sentiment predictions are directly tied to sales trends, highlighting how customer feedback can influence profitability.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- R (dplyr, ggplot2, sentimentr, multinom, wordcloud, tm, and more)  
- VADER sentiment analysis  
- Feature engineering and multinomial regression modeling  
- Data visualization tools  

## Outcomes  
This project showcases my ability to apply **data preprocessing**, **NLP techniques**, and **predictive modeling** to real-world datasets. The insights derived from the analysis are actionable, providing a deeper understanding of customer sentiment and its influence on business outcomes.
